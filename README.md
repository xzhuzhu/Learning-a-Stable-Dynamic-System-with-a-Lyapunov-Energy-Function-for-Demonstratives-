# Learning-a-Stable-Dynamic-System-with-a-Lyapunov-Energy-Function-for-Demonstratives-using-neural-networks

The main code is borrowed from https://github.com/mrana6/euclideanizing_flows but using two three-layers-neural-networks to replace the original invertible-neural-networks, so that can it can learn much faster. Meanwhile, learning the implicit variable as y=x+f(x), within the stucture of neural networks, the Jacobian matrices are almost invertible. However, this property does not ensure global asymptotic stability. In contrast, by employing the diffeomorphism transformation introduced in this paper, the resultant vector field is not only smoother but also endowed with guaranteed stability.
