# Learning-a-Stable-Dynamic-System-with-a-Lyapunov-Energy-Function-for-Demonstratives-using-neural-networks

The main code is borrowed from https://github.com/mrana6/euclideanizing_flows but using two three-layers-neural-networks to replace the original invertible-neural-networks
so that can it can learn much faster, and within the stucture of neural networks, the Jacobian matrices are almost invertible.
